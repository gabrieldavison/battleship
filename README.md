# battleship

A classic game of battleships. This was completed as part of The Odin Project's Javascript course. To play you must place your ships and then take turns against a computer guessing where their ships are located. The winner is the first to sink all of their opponents ships.

In this project I wanted to become more comfortable using Javascript classes to structure my code. This was also my first attempt at a React app and using create-react-app to bootstrap the setup.
